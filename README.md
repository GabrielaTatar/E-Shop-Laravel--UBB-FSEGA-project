# E-Shop-Laravel--UBB-FSEGA-project

I used the Laravel framework with Livewire UI to create an online store which has 2 interfaces based on the identity of the user (admin/client). The admin can make CRUD operations on products. I created a categorised drugstore. Each product has a details page. All the data is being saved in a phpMyAdminÂ database.
